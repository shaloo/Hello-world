GitHub Integration

GitBook helps authors to focus on the content while it abstracts the change management activities seamlessly via GitHub integration.  Writers can make changes to the content.  In the background, GitBook bot connects up with GitHub account and the repository corresponding to the book/content.  All changes made via GitBook are available in the GitHub.

Workflow

Actual: Open GitBook, start editing, Publish

Transparent:  GitBook integrates with GitHub, creates a branch and does all edits in the branch, when user publishes all the changes are put in a pull request, merged into main repository and both areas synchronised.

Troubleshooting

If the user is working in parallel on the GitHub repository, there is a chance that one or the other changes will be overwritten.  Do not make changes in both places.
